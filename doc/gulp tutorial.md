# GULP

Gulp is a tool that allows you to automate repetitive tasks in your web development workflow, such as CSS and JS file compilation, image optimization, automatic browser reloading and much more.

Imagine having to perform repetitive tasks like compiling your SASS files to CSS, concatenating and minifying your JS files, and optimizing your images for the web. Doing these tasks manually can be tedious and time-consuming, especially if you have a lot of files to manage.

Gulp allows you to automate these tasks by defining a series of "tasks" in a Gulp configuration file. These tasks can be configured to run automatically when they detect a change in the source files. In this way, you can save time and avoid errors by automating tasks that you previously had to do manually.
